            <p>I talked ‘til my face turned blue,
Stood there in pain—not one word out of you.
Had a whole lot of chances, to just let me be,
When I made my bail, you still chained me.

If you forgot all the details, I could understand,
But you remembered every move, except the knife in your hand.
And by that, you know I mean the lies,
To all of my who, what, when, where’s, and why’s?

But none of it mattered, not to you,
They were just cute guys to get you through.
Who they were, where they stayed,
Didn’t matter, long as they played.

You buried me deep in gaslit graves,
Chained my trust, made me your slave.
A kiss on my lips, a knife in my back,
Said it was love, but it felt like attack.

You held my heart like a loaded gun,
Safety off, nowhere to run.
One last bullet, one last lie,
One last look in your hollow eyes.

And I stopped fearing death, ’cause you made it seem kind,
Made living feel like I was losing my mind.
If heaven was peace, and hell was you,
Why the hell would I fight to break through?

You called me crazy when I begged for the truth,
Treated my love like some kind of proof,
That no matter how much you tore me apart,
I’d still hand you my bleeding heart.

You’d watch me drown, then call it fair,
Say you cared—you were never there.
Said you loved me, said I mattered,
Yet somehow, I’m the only one shattered.

I don’t remember love feeling like war,
Didn’t think I had to beg for more.
Didn’t think I’d watch you win,
By hiding sins beneath my skin.

Kept me guessing, made me plead,
Let me bleed out, watching me need.
And when I begged for honesty, you played dumb,
Like it was a game, like I was numb.

But I ain't numb, I feel it all,
Every crack, every break, every hard-ass
And if death came knocking, I wouldn’t run,
‘Cause you already killed me—lie by one.
