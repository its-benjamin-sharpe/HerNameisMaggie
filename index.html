            <h2>Another Sleepless Night Over Yourself</h2>
            <p>You say it’s another sleepless night over me. I say it’s another sleepless night over yourself.</p>
            <p>You clearly need something I cannot offer. I mean that as sincerely as one could after being accused of such bizarre shit...</p>
            <p>I even went to the furthest extent and told you that if you had lied or kept something from me, I could understand...</p>
            <p>Let me rephrase something—because you probably never saw the apartment as a home...</p>
            <p>Everything was off.</p>
            <p>I had never asked a question I already knew the answer to just to see if you would lie...</p>
            <p>Listen, nobody—and I mean nobody—who truly loves someone sits back and watches them go through that...</p>
            <p>By God, it is me.</p>
            <p>I’m the fool who is so hopelessly desperate to be loved, to be cared for...</p>
            <p>And yet, if you really believed the things you accused me of, you never would have come back...</p>
            <p>Stop pretending.</p>
            <p>Stop trying to convince me—hell, stop trying to convince yourself...</p>
            <p>You’ve always been a pro at lying.</p>
            <p>And I knew that from the moment you were telling your mother you were at Autumn’s house...</p>
            <p>I pray one day, someone comes along that you actually want to act right for...</p>
            <p>But you and I both know—you won’t read this far.</p>
            <p>And if you do, you won’t really hear it.</p>
