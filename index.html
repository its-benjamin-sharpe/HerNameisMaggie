            <h2>Another Sleepless Night Over Yourself</h2>
            <p>You say it’s another sleepless night over me. I say it’s another sleepless night over yourself.</p>

            <p>You say it’s another sleepless night over me. I say it’s another sleepless night over yourself.
You clearly need something I cannot offer. I mean that as sincerely as one could after being accused of such bizarre shit. I cannot help but think there's no hope because I have deliberately told you how fucked up I think it is—the way you kept lying when I asked so many times about the cats, about where you stayed during the time we were apart, who you were with. Even when we were talking regularly and living together again, I asked more times than I could ever count if there was someone else when we weren't together, if there was someone else while we were together, if this or that was true, if you were keeping anything from me.
I even went to the furthest extent and told you that if you had lied or kept something from me, I could understand—it’s hard to turn around from a lie because the sole purpose of not telling the truth is either to avoid hurting someone or to avoid them seeing you for what you really are. Either way, it's about protection—either of yourself or of me. I even gave you a chance, saying you could change your answer, come clean, and just tell me the truth. But I never felt right about anything—not at the apartment, not in the basement, not when I laid next to you, not when I picked you up from work.
Let me rephrase something—because you probably never saw the apartment as a home. No wonder you wanted to move—your ex still had your things just a few houses down the road. That’s why you wanted to move from there so badly, not because we needed a fresh start, but because you needed a clean slate for your next phase of bullshit. Telling me how you were “fixing Katelyn’s bathroom” or whatever, I knew something was off. Giving me the runaround, claiming to love me, making up some more bullshit excuse that I was supposed to just blindly believe… I knew. I just refused to believe it.
Everything was off.
I had never asked a question I already knew the answer to just to see if you would lie, but then I caught on. I realized—you did not care how stupid I looked. You did not care that I took what you said to heart, blindly believing you. I trusted you, and you saw the struggle. You saw the emotional toll. You have been watching me throw my life away, shaving years off every single day while you gaslight and mentally torture me. But how dare I know and question it?
Listen, nobody—and I mean nobody—who truly loves someone sits back and watches them go through that, especially when they are the cause of it. It is one thing to have little to no control over things. But you—remember how bent out of shape I was over things not adding up? My gut telling me something was off, yet you couldn’t even ease the pain? My pain, that you were causing. And you couldn’t stop for two seconds and think:
"That guy there may not have treated me the best at times, but he is still here. And he is trying… I should give him a break and just stop while I am this far ahead because one of these days, I will not be able to keep up with the things I have told him, and I will only ruin and waste his time and mine."
Nope. Because Maggie only ever cares about herself. At least, the version of Maggie you deliberately choose to give me every day when you wake up.
The only kind of person who does what you do is someone who doesn’t give a single shit about the person they’re with. Someone who feeds off their suffering, who enjoys making sure they never have a good day, who makes sure they never get the chance to heal.
It’s all so obvious now—like it was written for a book, and the author put it in plain terms. Because after five years, the lies, the cycles, the manipulation—they’ve never changed. And yet, you have the nerve to say it’s me?
By God, it is me.
I’m the fool who is so hopelessly desperate to be loved, to be cared for, that I don’t even have the spine to walk away. That’s on me. Because you made up your mind about me from day one. You accused me of everything under the sun—not because I did those things, but because you did. Your guilt ate you alive, and you projected it onto me, digging for any little thing you could find. A single hair of a different color? Enough evidence for you. You needed me to be guilty because you couldn’t handle your own guilt.
And yet, if you really believed the things you accused me of, you never would have come back. Not once. But you did—again and again. Because you didn’t love me. You loved the power you had over me.
You got your fix—the “single mom life,” as you put it. But then you realized something. You realized you had someone you could walk all over. Manipulate. Control. You got the best of both worlds: the ability to do whatever (or whoever) you wanted and the security of knowing I was still there. A safety net. A backup plan.
You never stopped playing the field. From the second you realized it was all a game to you, you never stopped. Because as long as you had somewhere or someone to take advantage of, you felt whole. That’s how you’re wired. And that’s why a monogamous relationship is not for you.
So stop pretending.
Stop trying to convince me—hell, stop trying to convince yourself. You do not have it in you. You are not what you claim to be. You could be honest, but you won’t be.
And by the way—you did block me on Snapchat. That’s why, when I look up your username on a different account, it still appears. I never blocked you. I never unadded you. But you lied to my face about it, like I’m nothing to you. Because I am nothing to you.
You’ve always been a pro at lying.
And I knew that from the moment you were telling your mother you were at Autumn’s house as you sat on my weed-infused couch. I knew what I was dealing with—someone who lies to get away with shit. Or let me rephrase that—someone who will say whatever it takes just to have their way, have their fun, without a care for the consequences. Someone who only behaves for themselves. Someone who always has something to hide.
You called me a liar, a cheater, a whore, a piece of shit—but it doesn’t hurt. Because I know what I did when we weren’t together. And I know what little you slipped up and let me find out about what you did. I mean, who you did.
I pray one day, someone comes along that you actually want to act right for. Someone who makes you stop the bullshit. Someone who makes you realize how easy it would have been if you had just been honest in the first place.
But you and I both know—you won’t read this far.
And if you do, you won’t really hear it.
